# Plan for Pre-commit Hook Enhancements

## Objective

Enhance the pre-commit hook to make it more strict and improve code quality checks.

## Tasks

1. Analyze the current pre-commit hook configuration
2. Identify areas for improvement based on project guidelines
3. Implement merge conflict detection
4. Implement large file detection
5. Implement TypeScript type checking
6. Implement test coverage threshold checks
7. Implement PHP static analysis with PHPStan
8. Implement PHP code quality checks with Rector
9. Implement PHP code formatting with Laravel Pint
10. Implement security vulnerability checks for dependencies
11. Ensure all checks run conditionally based on project configuration
12. Document all enhancements in a markdown file
13. Test the enhanced pre-commit hook
14. Update the pre-commit hook with all the enhancements

## Implementation Details

- For merge conflict detection, use grep to search for conflict markers
- For large file detection, use find to identify files larger than 1MB
- For TypeScript type checking, use tsc --noEmit
- For test coverage, set thresholds at 70% for statements, branches, functions, and lines
- For PHP static analysis, use PHPStan through composer analyze script
- For PHP code quality, use Rector through composer rector:dry-run script
- For PHP code formatting, use Laravel Pint through composer pint:test script
- For security vulnerability checks, use npm audit and composer audit

## Expected Outcome

A more robust pre-commit hook that:

- Prevents common issues from being committed
- Enforces code quality standards
- Runs efficiently by only executing relevant checks
- Aligns with the project's development guidelines
